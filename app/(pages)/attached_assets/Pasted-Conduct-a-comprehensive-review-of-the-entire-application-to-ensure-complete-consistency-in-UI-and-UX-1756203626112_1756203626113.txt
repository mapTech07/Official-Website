Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire application to ensure complete consistency in UI and UX across all pages, screens, and components.

Scope of Review:

Visual Design Consistency 
Verify uniform use of:
Colors (primary, secondary, error, success, etc.) — use defined design tokens.
Typography (h1 to h6, <p>, links) — consistent font family, size, weight, and line height.
Spacing (margins, padding) — follow a standard spacing scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px).
Shadows, borders, and radius — consistent button corners, card styles, and elevation.

Component Uniformity 
Ensure reusable components (buttons, inputs, dropdowns, modals, cards, loaders) look and behave the same everywhere.
Check that button styles (primary, secondary, danger) are used correctly and consistently.
Confirm form fields have uniform labels, placeholders, error states, and validation styles.

Layout & Grid Structure 
All pages should follow the same grid system and alignment principles.
Headers, footers, sidebars, and navigation bars should be consistent in structure and behavior.
Maintain consistent content width and container padding across breakpoints.

User Interaction & Feedback 
Ensure consistent hover, focus, active, and disabled states for interactive elements.
Standardize loading indicators, success messages, error toasts, and notification styles.
Use the same icons (from a single icon set) with consistent size and color usage.

Responsive Behavior 
Verify that all pages adapt smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
Navigation, forms, and data tables should remain usable and aligned on all devices.

Accessibility & Usability 
Maintain consistent focus indicators and keyboard navigation.
Use ARIA labels and semantic HTML uniformly.
Ensure sufficient color contrast and readable text sizes.

Goal: Deliver a cohesive, professional, and intuitive user experience where every page feels like part of the same product — no matter who built it or when.
